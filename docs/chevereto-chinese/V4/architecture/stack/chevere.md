## What it does?

Chevere was made for _this_ and Chevereto inherits many standards and concepts directly "as-is" from Chevere. It provides all the tooling required to write the application.

With Chevere, all the application endpoints can be driven as controllers for very-specific workflows (sequential typed actions that runs on demand). Thanks to this we can create code both easy to test and to extend, enabling us to provide support for third-party plugins and addons that will make your installation more tailored for your unique needs.
