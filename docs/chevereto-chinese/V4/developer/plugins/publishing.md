# ðŸ›° Plugin Publishing

Publishing your plugins will make your addons available to other Chevereto V4 users.

## Preparation

Publishing a plugin means that the code will be available to others. Take time and care to publish your stuff following our recommendations:

* Use [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
* Implement our code style.
* Provide Tests

## Licensing

Your created plugins can be released under any license, is your code after all.

## Distribution

You can distribute your plugins using:

* Chevereto Store
* [Packagist](https://packagist.org/)
