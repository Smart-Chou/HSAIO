# ðŸš€ Upgrading

This section outlines the upgrade process required to install V4 from previous major release.

## Requirements

* Working clean V4 installation `latest-release`
* Working previous installation
  * Chevereto V3.20.X `latest-release`

## Steps

The upgrade process is more precisely an importing process on top of a clean installation. It works by importing your existing Chevereto V3 installation.
